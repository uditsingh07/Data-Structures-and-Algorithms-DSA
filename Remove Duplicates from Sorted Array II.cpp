/* Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

int removeDuplicates(vector < int > & nums) {
  int size = nums.size();

    return size;

  for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() - 2; i++) {
    if (nums[i] == nums[i + 2]) {
      nums.erase(nums.begin() + i + 2);
      i--;
    }
  }
  return nums.size();
