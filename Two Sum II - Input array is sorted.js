/* Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.


Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

var twoSum = function(numbers, target) {
    let res = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
            if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] === target) {
                res.push(i + 1, j + 1);
            }
